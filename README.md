# Codewars Challenges

## Challenge #1
### Stop gninnipS My sdroW!
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

Examples: spinWords( "Hey fellow warriors" ) => returns "Hey wollef sroirraw" spinWords( "This is a test") => returns "This is a test" spinWords( "This is another test" )=> returns "This is rehtona test

*Spinning words
 fixed tests (8 of 8 Assertions)
 random tests (50 of 50 Assertions)*

## Challenge #2
### A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages
